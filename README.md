# MQTT_Camera_Parking_Sensor
 Java Webcam MQTT parking sensor app

A small camera based parking MQTT sensor that monitors free parking lots.

MQTT parameters and credentials are configurable in TXT files that are generated in "res" folder.
So after editing any parameters or credentials, app needs to be restarted, because they are loaded at startup only.
